This program is not completted because of the midterms :( 
Thus, if a bug occur. plz reopen the programme. THX a lot.

Plz click on the Excavator's body to load the programme( directly click on the arms
some times work but not always) PS: don't know why it happens and how to debug it. :(

first part: moving 
Only the body of the excavator can be drag to move by the left button of the mouse.
All other part will move with the body.
If you click on the Treads, the same affact will happen as you click on the body

second part: rotate
The direction of the rotating is correct. However, the upper and lower bound of the 
rotate angle is NOT set. (it couble ridiculous when you exceed the bounds. However,
the arms will move slower when you approach the bounds.)

third part : scale

You can right click on the excavator (only the body or Treads) to scale it.

This part is not done well because the scale factor calculation is not done well.  
But in general. when you right-click and move the mouse top-left, the excavator will
 become small. when you right-click and move the mouse bottom-right, the excavator 
will become big.

Fourth part: script

The quit script is done correctly

The reset script is not done correctly .(It will open a new window with correct status.
